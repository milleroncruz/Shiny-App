# Rania Milleron - Shiny App
In creating a Shiny App, I am learning the basics of using R to generate useful data visualizations for genomic epidemiology. The sample project allows the user to interact with a SARS-CoV-2 variant dataset pulled from publically available CDC data. When you run the script I have included in R, an app will populate to allow the geographical region and date to be selected by the user who can explore where and when variants are circulating.  Run the code and let me know how you use Shiny Apps in genomic epidemiology.
