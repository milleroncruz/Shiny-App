# Rania Milleron - Shiny App
In creating a Shiny App, I am learning the basics of using R to generate data visualizations that are useful for genomic epidemiology. The point of this project is to show the skills I am developing in R that can communicate data in many other situations related to genomic epidemiology. In the project example, I created a shiny-app to allow the user to interact with a SARS-CoV-2 variant dataset pulled from publically available CDC data. When you run the script I have included here an app will populate where the public health region and the time frame can be selected to interactively learn about variants circulating based on your interest. Run the code and let me know how you might use a shiny app in genomic epidemiology.
